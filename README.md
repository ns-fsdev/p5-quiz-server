##  Description
    Questions App.
    this is an app to record questions
    and answers by a user.

##  Content:
    This app is in two separate parts Server and Client
    and function independently.

    The code in this repo is for the Question App Server,
    see below:  

    Server -       ExpressJS app that can route
                   API requests to read and write
                   questions to a MySQL database.

                   Access to the server is handled by
                   PassportJS authentication.



    Client -       Front End client that provides the user
                   interface to add questions and answers
                   and delete questions and answers.
                   The user has to login and data is stored
                   by user.
                   API endpoint calls are made to the server.

                   This is written in ReactJS,
                   Javascript.
